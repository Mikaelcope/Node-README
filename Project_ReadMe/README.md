# Bootstrap-Portfolio
Creating a portfolio to showcase my web developments skills as well as previous work.

## Discription
I have created a url that willl showcase my capabilities using HTML, Bootstrap and CSS. I will include projects that I have once completed. I will create links to other URLs (placeholders) as I do not have projects to fill my page. I will expand on this work the further into web development I dive and the more skills and knowledge I gain. 

### Installation
Click on the following link to access the URL:
https://mikaelcope.github.io/Bootstrap-Portfolio/


### Usage
Once the URL has loaded this is what you will see: 
![alt text](./Images/Screenshot%202.png)
The navigational buttons will direct you through the page.
The previous work display has link buttons to the webpages.
There are hyperlinks and a drop down to get in touch.
